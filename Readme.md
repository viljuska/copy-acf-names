# Copy acf field names to clipboard

## Installation

2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable developer mode
4. Click on `Load unpacked`
5. Select the folder where you downloaded the extension
6. You should see the extension in the list

Since original extension doesn't work anymore in chrome, I created one for myself, so I can copy acf field names easily.

I might add some updates in the future, but for now, it's just a simple extension that copies acf field names to clipboard.
